Always wanted buildings to be built down instead of up - to stop humans from occupying the surface and displacing all of the surface animals. This has only ever been done on a very small scale, never with skyrises, mostly due to the cost of escavation and troubles with getting a solid foundation. 
Paradigm Flip: rather than bring humans under the earth's surface, bring the earth's surface over the humans.
